###These tools are designed to explore the ways that ecological models and databases could be used to help support biosecurity awareness and decision-making when choosing and procuring plants for planting in the wider environment. They were developed as part of two projects funded by Scotland's Plant Health Centre.

<br>

###Each of the pages below allows you to interact with the outputs from a model or dataset. There is a short survey attached to each section, asking for feedback on whether, and how, you might use these tools.  
<br>
<br>

## [Where are new pests and pathogens coming from?](<trade_flows.html>) 
####Risk factors for import: Pathogen source regions, global trade networks, climate-matching, exporter biosecurity and pathogen traits
<br>  

## [Which areas of the UK are at risk from pest or pathogen species?](<ramorum_niche.html>)
####Environmental risk factors for establishment, UK suitability and outbreaks in the wider environment for 9 Phytophthora species  
<br> 

## [Which pest and pathogen species are plants and trees susceptible to?](<Phytophthora_hosts.html>) 
####Known host-pathogen associations and the geographic origin of the reports  
<br>  

## [Risk assessing wider environment planting schemes: juniper case study](<National_maps_for_PHCworks.html>)  
####Supplementary juniper planting as a potential pathway by which the pathogen could be introduced or spread.   
<br>  

## [A decision support framework for assessing climate change impact on tree and plant pests and diseases](<climate_modelling_cost_benefit.html>)
