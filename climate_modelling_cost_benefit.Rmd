####The aim of the project was to construct a framework which allows analysis of the effects of climate change on emergence and spread of plant and tree pests and diseases. A novel modelling framework has been constructed combining epidemiological and economic modelling and implemented in a user-friendly online app. The framework has been combined with a literature review to obtain estimates of epidemiological parameters and economic values (both market and non-market) for the selected pests and hosts. Future climate change scenarios have been incorporated together with the impact if increased temperature on pests. The app can be used to study predictions of spread and economic impact of pests in forestry or agriculture settings.

####The web/desktop application can be accessed via any of the three links below.
